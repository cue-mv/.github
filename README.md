# `cue-mv`

The `cue-mv` GitHub organization is a temporary and secure staging area for the [CUE open source project](https://cuelang.org). 
It is used to facilitate the safe transfer of repository ownership from external maintainers to the CUE 
project before the repositories are moved to their target organization. This mitigates the risk of granting 
temporary access to more sensitive CUE project organizations.
